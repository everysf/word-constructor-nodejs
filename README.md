# Word Constructor!

Word constructor is a fun word guessing game that allows users to test their wit by entering letters and guessing the answer all within their terminal.

## Node JS!

This project is aimed to display applicable knowledge of Node.js. I found Node.js to be one of the easiest and most versatile languages that I have had experience with. I look forward to learning more about its sublties and building bigger and badder projects.

## Technical

This game uses inquirer to run the question prompts, so make sure you npm initalize and install before playing in your terminal.
